### Swipe
This is an off-hand attack that has a scaling chance based on a calculated value.

### Natural Attack
This allows them to use their claws for damage. When the player starts off at level 1 they will have 10% already learned and their damage is based off character level, warrior level, and strength.

### Rend
This ability can only be used when the target is based. It will deal a good amount of damage to the target if they aren't wearing any armor, and if they are wearing armor it will have a chance to remove it, placing the armor piece to the target's inventory. It will be a random roll on where the attacks hits with favor to the chest.

### Maul
This attack is a debuff and buff skill. When the Beorning does a maul on a target it will give them negatives to OB and DB, while applying a small amount of armor absorption to the Beorning. This ability will stack up to 5 times.

### Bite
This will be a standard damage attack on the target, and apply a small delay on both the target and beorning.
