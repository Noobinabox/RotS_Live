# Olog-Hai Race Configuration

Listed below is all the racial configuration and design for Olog-Hais.

* Can't be targeted with healing spells

* Bite Ability
* Infravision
* POA
* Overrun
* Cleave
* Smash

### Overrun
When given a direction the Olog-Hai will charge through each room bashing every mob as he moves through it. This will be a calculated distance or until the player can't go any further. The attack will do damage to everything that doesn't save, and the Olog-Hai if he doesn't charge long enough. (Slamming into a wall at full force.) The Olog isn't required to be mounted for his attack, but he will get bonuses if he is.

### Cleave
This attack will damage everything in the room, and the damage will be greatly increased if the Olog is using a heavy two-handed weapon.

### Smash
This will function as swing does however it will have the chance of dismounting the target and applying a small delay to them. If they are dismounted from the attack it will do increased damage. There is also a small chance it will damage and bash the mount as well.
