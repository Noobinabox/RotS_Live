At the end of the Third Age of Arda, Sauron, the hated Dark Lord, was
destroyed along with the One Ring, some say forever.  Most of the evil
beings of Middle-Earth fled and hid themselves at the roots of the world, in
deep, dark caves and forgotten forests. The Free Peoples of Arda once again
found happiness, and travelled the world, and all was joyous for many a
year.

The world hath grown old since then, and the Valar have grown old
with it. It was therefore a surprise to all in Valinor when a dark cloud,
misshapen and blocking all light, began to form over the land of Middle-Earth.
What could be happening? What evil from past times could be troubling Arda
once again?

Spirits and shadows are once again multiplying within the confines
of Middle-Earth, wandering in dark places.  Orcs are breeding again
in the dark caves and recesses of Mirkwood, muttering evil curses, and
staining the land with their foulness. The prophecies of the Istari
foretell that the Valar will no longer interfere with the dealings of the
lands of Men; most of the High Elves hath sailed to the Western lands.

And the Shadow continues to grow...
