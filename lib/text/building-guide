
- Describe the area, do not assume the character does or is doing anything.
  Do not assume the opinions, or race of a character... Somthing smelling
  bad is a good example... it might smell bad to a elf, but a troll might
  like that paticular smell. This also goes for the time of day, and other
  things that change continuously. Remain as Neutral as possible.

- Descriptions should be at least 4 lines long.

- Always Format your description with the %f option.

- Avoid the use of the words "You" and "Your" at all costs. Also avoid
  exclimation points, and such things as incomplete sentences, although
  they are used in literary works occassionally, please don't use them
  here.

- Don't forget to set exit_width (/12) for all exits, it is not
  easy to notice that they have not been set, so please don't
  forget them.

- No Death Traps.
