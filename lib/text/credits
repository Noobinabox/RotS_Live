Return of the Shadow is based on CircleMUD 2.0.

CircleMUD was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to (in alphabetical order):
Danny Baker, Bill Bogstad, Harold Ervin, Fenris, Jeff Fink, Furey, Gnort,
Sharon Goza, Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Jay Levino, Fred Merkel, Catherine
Stanton, Naved Surve, and Tim Stearns.  Circle would be different in some
way without the contributions of any of these people.

CircleMUD is available for anonymous FTP at ftp.cs.jhu.edu in pub/CircleMUD.
Its author can be contacted at jelson@cs.jhu.edu.
