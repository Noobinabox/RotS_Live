STEALTH

Stealth, as commonly referred to in many of the skill manual
pages, is not precisely the stealth skill; rather, it refers to
one's overall concealment while in motion in a given scenario.
When calculating someone's stealth, the stealth skill of the
person performing a stealthy action is used - and this is the
primary basis for the final stealth calculation.  Nearly as
important as the knowledge of the stealth skill is the terrain -
forested terrains tend to give a hefty bonus to stealth, where
enclosed areas and cities tend to give hefty maluses.  Also
important when calculating stealth (though to a much lesser
degree) are specialization, race and encumbrance.

#
NAMECHANGE

If you are in the same room as an innkeeper, you may now RENT
NAMECHANGE in order to permanently change your character's name.
Remember that you may only change a character's name once in its
lifetime, and that the immortal staff will not reimburse you for
a carelessly or poorly changed name.

> rent namechange <new name>

As a precautionary measure, we require that you enter the RENT
NAMECHANGE syntax twice in order for the change to take place.

#
LATIN1

Latin-1 is the extension of UTF-7 that allows one to display
letters with accents.

#
AUTODELETE

Over time, characters of level 20 and below will be subject to automatic
deletion.  The time to delete is roughly one week per level. Keep in mind that
retired characters will never delete with time.

See also: RETIRE
#
SWIM DROWNING

Swim is a ranger skill that allows one to pass over water-filled rooms 
without the aid of a boat. One must "set swim on" to enter one of these rooms.
By default, this setting is turned off so a player does not accidentally wander
into a water-filled room.  A check is made upon entering the room and every
so often afterwards. A failed check will result in the player struggling to
remain swimming. If the player continues to fail these checks, he/she may
drown. Drowning occurs after a certain amount of time has passed and does not
consider HP.	

See also: SET
#
POISON

A player may find that they are poisoned at some point throughout the game.
Mobs, objects, spells, and possibly other sources can cause this to occur.
The effects of being poisoned are a loss of strength, decrease in regen
rates of hp, stamina, and moves, and minor damage every "tick". The effects
of poison will wear off with time or with the help of spells/powers.

See also: "MAN POWERS RESIST POISON" "MAN POWERS REMOVE POISON"
#
MONEY GOLD

Money is found in the form of gold, silver, and copper coins. It can be used
for several purposes including buying equipment and (eventually) to pay for
rent. The conversions between coin types is as follows:
     1 Gold = 10 Silver = 1000 Copper
     1 Silver = 100 Copper = 1/10 Gold
     1 Copper = 1/100 Silver = 1/1000 Gold
#
NEWBIE
    Use help by typing 'help <topic>' or 'man <chapter> <topic>'.
    If you are new to muds, type 'help help'
    If you have experienced with muds in general, type 'help start'
#
RETIRE RETIRED

If you are retired, you will never autodelete with time, and you do not have
to pay for rent. However, retired players are not allowed to play the game,
but are placed in a secluded room away from the world, where they can talk
with players, and read news, and send and receive mail. Retired players must
remain retired for at least one month.

In order to retire, you must visit your local innkeeper, and request a
retirement. To do this, simply type RENT RETIRE.

> rent retire

Keep in mind that you must enter the RENT RETIRE syntax twice in order to
go through with the retirement process.

After thirty days of retirement, you will be allowed to leave the retirement
home via the LEAVE command.

> leave

#
HERO LEGEND

At level 30, players reach Legend status. When you become a legend,
your class levels no longer increase, experience is much harder to
gain, and you gain less hit points over time.

See also: LEVEL
#
ANGER NOQUIT

If you engage in a fight, your adrenaline level becomes very high and
you get affected by ANGER.

From OOC prospective, ANGER is a feature in the game that keeps any
player from renting or quitting after a fight. This is to make sure
that people do not quit in the middle of a fight (especially PK
fight). ANGER lasts about 2 minutes for attacking an NPC, and for
about 5 minutes for attacking a player.

ANGER was formerly known as NOQUIT.

START FAQ

Greetings, fellow traveler!

Welcome to Return of the Shadow, Arda the Fourth Age;
better known as simply ROTS. This is a guide that will give someone a
basic knowledge of the game and its workings. It is meant to show you 
how things work and point you towards areas where you may learn more
You can find formatted version at our website http://www.rotsmud.org.

To help you along until you learn your way around, the following are 
questions that are frequently asked me along with their answers:

Q1.  Where do I find newbie eq?

A1. As a new player you can gain a set of eq simply by typing 'ask' in
the room you first appear in ROTS. This will provide you with all the 
basics you need to get yourself going, and this command is also
re-usable after each death, and if your new they're will be a few of
them.  
Alternatively-
Newbie equipment may be found in a number of areas within each city:
junkyards, training grounds, storage huts, among other things. Each area may
have a different type of newbie equipment that is based upon the area where it
is found.  Newbie equipment generally consists of discarded items: Rusted
weapons and worn out armor.

Q2.  Where do I get money and buy things?

A2. Money is fairly difficult to come by in ROTS, at first. Each character
starts with enough money to buy some basic things such as a waterskin and some
cotton clothes. There are a number of weak enemies nearby that may have
money. There are things to look when finding a creature with cash. The main
thing to look for is whether or not the enemy is humanoid. The killing of good
people is generally frowned upon by other players and guards will not stand
for it and attack you. But the killing of thieves, brigands, and other
miscreants will go by unpunished.

Q3.  Where do I practice my skills and spells?

A3. There are teachers spread across Arda, hidden in towns, forests, and other
areas. Many are open and easy to find, it's best to ask another player where a
guildmaster may be found. Teachers usually specialize in a specific type of
abilities and spells and seldom learn others. To see the sort of spells you
can learn type "MAN SPELL LIST" To see the mystical powers that maybe learned
type "MAN POWER LIST" To see the skills that one may practice type "MAN SKILL
LIST". When at a guildmaster type "Practice" to see a list of the skills and
spells that may be learned. Type "Practice <skill>" and you will spend one
practice e session on that skill.

Q4.  Where is it safe to xp (get experience)?

A4. Experience plays a vital role in how the game works.  There are a number
creatures found everywhere on Arda. The generally safe areas to gain
experience near towns and in wide open areas.  Remember to type "consider
<target>" to see a creatures strength and level compared to yours. Keep an eye
on your health level and "flee" when it drops low, "Wounded" is generally a
safe time to flee so that leaves leeway for failed attempts. Keep in mind that
consider can be deceiving as to the actual strength of an opponent. Generally
farms that support life are a great place to sharpen ones skill and butcher
food "Butcher <target>" for one to eat. Remember dark areas are not usually a
good place to be without a light, there are spells that allow you to create
lights and see in the dark, and torches and other lights can be purchased in
various dry goods shops in each city.

Q5.  How does PKILLING work here?

A5. PKilling is possibly one of the most important things involved in the
game, but pkill must not be stepped upon with a light touch. Good Race
vs. Good Race is not allowed and any member of a "good" race who is caught
attacking another member of the "good" race will be dealt with harshly.
On the other hand, there is the other side of the war, two other
groups of players that play the game. These are the Orcs and Uruk-hai and the
Third Side, the Magi, or Uruk-Lhuth, These players will pkill each other and
will pkill the Good Races for fame and equipment. This is a major factor in
the game. As a beginner you should avoid encountering these races but when you
are a mature character and have experience in the game and its commands you
may find yourself to be a very good PKer. Keep in mind Pkilling is a
preference and is not a required part of the game.

Q6.  How do I get the gates of a city open?

A6.  There are a number of ways for a person to open a gate. First if you are
in a city you may attempt to open the gate or if that does not work "say open"
near a gatekeeper and he will open the door or gate that he is posted to. If
you are on the other side of a door or gate that has a gatekeeper try knocking
on the gate or door and the gatekeeper may open it.

Q7.  Other sources of information?

A7.  The game has a built-in manual that uses a ladder/topic system. To open
the manual type "MANUAL" and the proceed with "MANUAL <CHAPTER> <TOPIC>". (see
help Manual) The game also maintains a news system that can be read
anywhere. "NEWS" will bring up a list of the current news topics.  "News
<topic #> will bring up that specific news article. There are also bulletin
boards for mortal news, and in-character topics, stationed throughout the
towns, to use the board system "look board" and then "read board <topic #>.

Q8.   What are some of the more useful commands we may use on here?

A8.  A list of the various commands can be seen by typing "commands". Further
help on each command can be gained by typing "help <command>".  Some of the
more useful commands that you will want to read about are: Alias, assist,
butcher, compare, equipment, flee, inventory, rent, quit, rest,score, info,
set, sleep, where, and who. These are commands you will find yourself using
quite often during your travels through Arda so it is best to get familiar
with them as quickly as possible.

Q9.  Why won't some people help me?

A9. While it is generally nice to help people, there is no law that dictates
that higher levels should help newbies. Certain people have a belief system
that says that they shouldn't help newbies, others don't concern themselves
with it. As a newbie, it is important to realize that higher levels may or may
not help you with equipment or gold - its their choice. Usually, if anyone
feels like giving out some equipment or gold, they will give it
freely. Begging is highly disliked and if you plan on getting along with
others, do NOT beg.

Q10. What is spam?

A10. Spam is generally considered the repetition of some action that causes
someones screen to be full of useless information. If someone accuses you of
"spamming" them, it means that your constant yelling/narrating/shouting/
etc. has made them unable to do anything. As you might have already guessed,
spamming is frowned upon by management.

Good Luck and Have fun! But be nice for crying out loud.

#
EDITOR

  The editor commands are executed only if typed in the beginning of
the line - otherwise they are treated as a part of the text.
  You can also use '~' instead of '%' in all commands.

The following commands are available:

%e   - to finish the text;
%q   - to cancel the text;
%d   - to remove the previous line;
%d<+/-num> - to remove several lines back or forward;
%l   - to set the cursor at the end of the text;
%l<num> - to set the cursor after the line <num>;
%r   - to redisplay the text;
%s<old_string>~<new_string> - to replace all substrings;
%f   - to reformat the whole text;
%%   - to insert % sign;
%h   - to see this help.

Text is appended after the current position, at the end by default.
#
ANGEL PRACRESET RESET

A little temporary feature we have for the convenience of our players:
"tell angel pracreset" will reset all your practices

#
ALIAS

Syntax: alias                           - to list aliases
        alias <word> <substitution>     - to create an alias
        alias <word>                    - to clear alias

The alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this
time, aliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than
one command.  Alias by itself lists your current aliases, and alias
with both a word and and argument produces a new alias.  You can alias
either alias or existing command to a new command, so beware of
consequences.  Alias <word> removes alias (if such exists).  Examples
of use (and misuse):

Good use:
alias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'
alias cc cast 'chill ray' --> cc orc will equal "cast 'chill ray orc'

Poor use: 
alias alias smile --> typing 'alias' will equal typing 'smile'
Consequent typing 'alias gc get all corpse' will equal typing 'smile
gc get all corpse', interpreted as 'smile gc' and will return 'Nobody
here by that name.'.  To clean this misunderstanding, type: "al alias"

Only the first word on the line will be substituted at this time.
#
LOOK
For studying your surroundings. Examples:
look                                      
look AT angel
look IN bag
look to south   (or just: look south)

Note that if you LOOK AT CORPSE you will not see its inventory.
To see what's inside a container (i.e. a corpse) use LOOK IN <OBJECT>.

If you want to see the condition of your friend or enemy, you can
look person
to see the condition and that person's equipment, or just
diagnose person.

#
OB "OFFENSIVE BONUS"

This number shows how well you can attack your enemies. The higher
your OB is compared to DB and PB of your enemy, the more chance you have 
to hit your foe. Learning and using weapons can greatly increase your OB.

#
DODGE "DODGE BONUS" DB

#
PARRY "PARRY BONUS" PB

Parrying bonus (PB) displays how well you can parry enemy hits with your
weapon and shield. After you deflect an enemy blow, it will take you some
time to raise your shield back into its original position. During that time,
you will not be able to parry as well as you do with the shield up.
Parrying bonus can be increased by learning the corresponding warrior's
skill (MAN SKILL PARRY)

See also: DODGE, SCORE, INFO
#
"ATTACK SPEED" SPEED

This value shows you how fast you can lift your weapon and deliver a blow.
The heavier weapon you have, the more your strength affects this speed.
The lighter weapon you have, the more your dexterity affects this speed.
Rangers are famous for hitting very often, while delivering fairly small
damage each hit.  Fast hits significantly lower opponent's defense.
Warriors are known for using large (often two handed) weapons.  They hit
rarely, but when they do, they hit very hard and very accurate.

STAMINA SPIRIT

Stamina is your "magical" capacity.  It determines amount of magical
spells you can cast.  Spirit is your "mystic" capacity (see MAN POWER
GENERAL).  It determines amount of mystical spells you can cast. Stamina
regenerates with time. Spirit can be gained by concentrating with

TITLE

Usage: set title <title>

Sets the title people see on the WHO list and when you're in the room with
them.  You can't use parentheses (the "(" and ")" characters) because those
are reserved for flags. Titles are designed to increase roleplaying and are
not intended to make statements about real life, opinions on people places
or things, nor are they to be used for communicating with anyone else.

Titles may only be set after a character reaches level 20.

SCORE AFFECTIONS
Short versions of command INFO.

Score:
Whenever you want to check whether you're still alive and healthy
or simply want to see how much money you have left.

Command affections reports spells cast on you, and several other effects, like
noquit and sun penalties for uruks/orcs.  
Shorthand for AFFECTIONS is

INFO
Gives more detailed information about your character then score.
This includes stats, experience, playing times, you levels in different
classes, etc.

One of the line mentions specialization - see SPECIALIZE (man spec all) 
for more details.

#
ENCUMBRANCE

If you were naked all the time, you would be able to anything you want.
However, you would normally wear something and carry some INVENTORY.  Items
that you wear add to your encumbrance.  In fact, the heavier and bulkier your
item is, the harder it will be for you to move around (MOVE ENCUMBRANCE) and
to use your skills and spells properly (SKILL ENCUMBRANCE).  See INFO how
much you are encumbered.

See also: INFO.
#
PREPARE

To prepare a spell, just simply type "prepare <spell name>". When you
cast a prepared spell, it has a short delay *after* you cast the
spell.  The delay length is random, but always much shorter than the
spell casting time itself.  While you have a prepared spell, you can
only perform basic things, such as walking and talking, without
ruining your prepared spell.

Currently, there is no skill involved in preparing (besides knowing of
the spell of course), but this will probably change sometime in the future.

NOTE that anything that requires concentration or confuses you will
ruin your prepared spell. Particularly, "concentrate" command and hunting
will do it.

#
MAP ZONE WORLD

  The "world" command will display a map of the entire game. Please note
that this map may be too large for some terminals.

  The "map" command is a display of a smaller area of the world map. It
moves dynamically as you move through the game. 

Legend:

   - Road                 E - Erebor/Lonely Mountain
   * Forest               D - Dale
   h Hills                T - Thranduil's Halls
   " Plains               M - Maethelburg
   % Swamps/wetlands      R - Ranger outpost
   ^ Mountains            L - Lake-town (Esgaroth)
   ~ Water                + - crossroads/intersection
   
   X - this where you are

#
GSAY GTELL

Usage: gtell <your message>
Gsay command is disabled - use gtell instead.

Tell something to all the members of your group, even if they're not
in the room.  The people in a room with you will also hear what you say.
# 
KILL HIT 

A good way to start a fight.  Not a good idea to hit other players.
You will engage in "regular fight".

To engage into mental fight, use command WILL.

See also: PKILL BUTCHER BEHEAD WILL
#
WILL MENTAL AUTOMENTAL

Mystics have the ability to force their mind against others'.  This is
most useful against foes from the spirit world, but can also be used
against normal mobs and other players.  To do this, the mystic must
WILL his/her opponent.  This is equivalent to Kill or Hit.  A
successful hit will reduce the opponent's stats or could result in a
gain of spirit.  The mystic's will, perception, and mystic level
determines success.  Automental mode can be turned on and off by
typing "set mental on/off" or toggled by typing "set mental toggle".
Being in mental mode is not necessary, as one can WILL during regular
combat.  The use of mental abilities causes a short mental delay
during which time no other mental abilities may be used.

#
PK "PLAYER KILL" PKILL "RACE WAR"

Return of the Shadow has a race war. All "good" races vs "evil" races. If
you are to come across a race that is the member of the opposite side of
the war, you will see that player by his or her race name only, such as
*an Uruk* or *a Hobbit*. If you are to come across a member of the opposite
race you have two choices: Kill or be Killed. There is no mercy. If you win
you can become famous (see FAME). If losing, flee for your life!

There are rules pertaining to the race war :

- No communication.
     You cannot give any vital, or useful, or any kind information to
     a member of the opposite side. Taunting and Antagonizing is quite 
     alright, provided it is presented in a roleplaying manner.

- The 20 Minute Rule.
     You must be out of the game (all characters rented) for at least 20
     minutes before changing sides of the race war. You also cannot carry
     over any information you might know about the opposite side when you
     log on. For details, see "POLICY"

- No Help.
     You cannot assist a member of the opposite race in any way. This means
     Trading/Giving equipment or gold, assisting killing a mob, or casting
     a useful spell on them (unless that useful spell might also have its
     drawbacks, such as curing saturation and restlessness). Leaving a
     victims equipment on their corpse is not considered helping them, yet
     taking it and dropping it somewhere else for them to reacquire is
     considered helping them.

IMPORTANT: Use command "policy" to see applicable latest rules.

Side note: Players of good races should not kill each other.
Killing good race player by another good race player is considered a crime
and punishable by the Watch or the Immortals.

See also: FAME 
#
FAME

   Fame is currently in testing, so please report all bugs and
inconstancy's you find with it.  Fame measures the achievements of that
person.  Player kills of the opposite side have the most value, but
level and gold amount matters as well.
   Your fights with other people are recorded, and can be seen by others, as 
well as by yourself. The fame received in a fight depends on the relative 
levels of the killer and the victim. The time your fight will be remembered 
also depends on that. If several people overcame one, their effective level 
is a sum of their levels, and the resulting fame is divided between killers.
  INCOGNITO option affects the fame greatly. If the killer is incognito,
no fame is gained, since he prefers to remain unknown. If there are
incognito people in a group of killers, their deed is known, but only
for two days. If an incognito person dies, curiosity and exaggerations
will make the fight remembered for longer, as if the victim was level 40.
The fame gained or lost, though, is not affected.
   You can type "fame <name>" to see what is known about other people,
or type "fame all" to see the list of all known fights.

#
EXPLOITS

Usage: exploits

  This command gives you history of your character. Exploits
record all player kills, all deaths and all stat increases.
  The final line in exploits shows various total figures. These include:

pdeaths    - the total number of times you've died to other players.
pkills     - the total number of times you've killed another player.
mobdeaths  - the total number of times you've died to a computer mob.
notes      - notes the management uses for managing purposes.

Common question: A * before words "Died to <name>" means a group
including the <name> killed you. Exploits do not remember everyone
in the group, however, FAME does.

See also: FAME.
#
TACTICS BERSERK AGGRESSIVE NORMAL CAREFUL DEFENSIVE
Usage: set tactics ?       to see tactics available
       set tactics agg     to use aggressive tactics

You can determine the way your character fights by setting your tactics.
Tactics make your defensive and offensive ability increase or decrease,
depending on your setting. These are the possible tactics:
 
Berserk
Aggressive
Normal
Careful
Defensive
 
The higher on this scale your tactics are set to, the more likely you will hit
your opponent, but you are also more likely to get hit. As for more defensive
tactics, you will be less likely to hit, but will be much harder to hit as
compensation.

Note that effective usage of berserk tactics requires berserk skill.
For example, you cannot flee while employing berserk tactics without 
knowing the skill.

#
RIDE HORSES MOUNTS WARGS

To ride on a mount. Use DISMOUNT to get off the mount.  The mount will 
automatically follow you.
 
If you type 'ride' without any commands, you will try to ride a mount that
is following you.  If you currently don't have a mount following you, 
find one and 'ride <name of mount>'

You may not be able to ride indoors.

Note that riding a mount if fairly exhausting process, but the better you
know RIDE skill (man skill ride) the better you are in control of your horse,
and the less tired you get from controlling your horse.

Note: There is also a bug that allows you to ride mounts for other races, making use of this bug is considered illegal and is punishable. The following are the mounts that are permitted for the respective races:

Horses        - Humans and Elves
Wild Horses   - Humans and Elves
Mules         - Hobbits and Dwarves
Ponies        - Hobbits and Dwarves
Wargs         - Uruk-Hai, Orcs and Orc followers
Spotted Wargs - Uruk-Lhuth
Dark Horses   - Uruk-Lhuth

CAST SPELL SPELLS POWERS

For "magical" people. If you want to throw a spell at someone or something.
Example : cast 'burning hands' <player>
If a name of the spell is short, or obvious, you can omit '
Example: cast firebolt <player>
Same syntax applies to mystical powers.

As you cast your spell, you get a delay while concentrating on your
spell.  Make sure not to get hit - any damage to you while
concentrating will ruin your spell.

To see the list of spells/powers see "man spell/power list".  To see help 
on an individual spell/power, use "man spell/power <spell name>", for example
  > man spell magic missile
  > man spell fireb

#
BUY SELL LIST VALUE
Commands for the shops - very useful too!
#
WEATHER
If you're uncertain whether the sun is shining or the rain is pouring down.

The weather command also tells what season the mud is currently in.
#
READ
When you want to read something.
#
SHOPS
Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is of
high quality!
   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

COMMANDS

A canonical list of all the known verbs.

#
WARRIOR

Warriors are very proficient in raw fighting skill, and are generally well
trained in their knowledge of the wilderness.  However, they are rather
mediocre in their talent as a cleric and only partially tuned to the spirit
world.  Their knowledge of magery is generally lacking.

See also: BARBARIAN, CLASS
#
BARBARIAN

Barbarians are warriors in the extreme: while they do not forego any of the
knowledge of wilderness and stealth that normal warriors possess, they
sacrifice most of their understanding of the Wraith world and all of their
magical instincts to achieve an uncanny level of pure, brute strength.

See also: WARRIOR, CLASS
#
RANGER

Rangers are the masters of stealth and wilderness: they are well trained
in the handling of animals, herblores and tracking.  Rangers do not tend
to be accustomed to the aggressive style of fighting that marks a seasoned
warrior; instead they depend on their nimble movements and quick reflexes
for a defensive style of combat.  The average ranger's understanding of
magical arts is only mediocre; but rangers, being attuned to natural
environs, are completely uncomfortable with clerical duties and the world
of wraiths.

See also: SWASHBUCKLER, CLASS
#
SWASHBUCKLER

The term 'swashbuckler' is reserved for those rangers who have directed
an unusual effort to their warrior training.  These gruff, hardy men are
generally trained in both aggressive and defensive fighting styles, though
most still do not forego the protection of a shield.  As a result of their
more rigorous warrior training, swashbucklers are somewhat less comfortable
in the wilderness; furthermore, these men tend to ignore the magical arts:
whether they be clerical or magery.

See also: WARRIOR, RANGER, CLASS
#
MYSTIC

Mystics are rare in Arda; while most of Arda's inhabitants avoid wraiths
and their kin at all costs, these daring souls have heightened their
perception of the spiritual world in hopes of coming in contact with its
undead inhabitants.  However, the common mystic does not narrow its scope of
study to the clerical arts: most mystics are able to employ the arts of
magery with decent success.  But as a consequence of this rigorous mental
training, mystics are left with very little training as a fighter, and with
a dismal knowledge of wilderness the outdoors.

See also: HEALER, CLASS
#
HEALER

Healers are an extreme form of the common mystic; these beings train and
focus their willpower and perception to an acute science: these are true
masters of the Wraith world.  As a consequence of being so devoted to the
routine study of spirits, healers are completely unaware of the workings
of the physical world, and are thus completely unversed in even the
simplest of survival skills and make rather terrible fighters.  On the
other hand, healers are no less versed than their mystic brethren in their
knowledge of wizardry.

See also: MYSTIC, CLASS
#
MAGE

Mages are experts of those magical arts which entail the manipulation of
the physical world: fire, lightning, ice and darkness.  In general, mages
make heavy use of their spells to cause as much physical harm to their
victim as possible.  However, the arts of magery also include control of
the physical body and scrying magics: teleportation and informative spells.
Mages generally receive a decent training in the aspects of the Wraith
world, and commonly find themselves knowledgeable enough in the arts of
animals and wilderness.  However, as mages spend most of their time
enthralled in intellectual pursuit, they neglect their physical bodies and
their ability to fight.

See also: WIZARD, CLASS
#
WIZARD

Wizards are mages in the extreme--they sacrifice many important clerical
studies, fighting abilities, and any of knowledge of stealth and wilderness
in order to gain deeper insight into the shaping and controlling of the
elements.  

See also: MAGE, CLASS
#
CONJURER

A conjurer is a magician who chooses to spend equal amounts of effort in
mastering magery and mysticism.  While gaining a very useful knowledge of
spell casting, conjurers tend to learn only rudimentary warrior and ranger
abilities.

See also: MAGE, MYSTIC, CLASS
#
ADVENTURER

The adventurer is truly a jack of all trades.  Adventurers are nearly equally
trained in every art--fighting, stealth, wilderness, and the mystical and
magical arts.  Of course, in order to sustain this wide array of skills,
the adventurer must only be trained to a mediocre level in each profession.

See also: CLASS
#
CLASS PROFESSION
This mud doesn't have classes in their classic sense. You can choose one of
the classes close to standard ones (like WARRIOR, MYSTIC, RANGER, BARBARIAN,
or others) at the entering prompt. For advanced players, the ability to design
OWN CLASS is available. Any class in the mud is to some percent warrior,
some percent mystic, some percent ranger, and some percent magic user. That
means that any class can practice in any guild, but your percentage in the
class affects how well you practice in certain guild. If you have 0% in some
class, you can't practice in corresponding guild.
   You can improve your skills by using the practice command.

See also: PRACTICE
#
PRACTICE PRACTISE

   Practice is the way you improve your spells and skills. You must go to
*any* guildmaster to let him/her help you improve. If you type practice, 
you will see which skills you can improve upon in this certain guild, and
how good you already are at these. You will also see the level to which
that particular guildmaster is able to to teach you. The levels are as
follows:
	Awful
	Bad
	Poor
	Average
	Fair
	Good
	Very Good
	Superb
	Mastered

   You can then use practice <skill>, to practice the appropriate skill.

   You will only gain a certain number of practice sessions for each level
that you gain. The amount of sessions gained depends on your LEARNING
ability, as represented in your LEA stat. You are not required to use these
sessions up as you get them; they may be saved until you feel like using
them up, or until you are able to reach the guildmaster you would like to 
practice at.
#
EXITS
Gives you a list of the obvious exits from your location. Of course, the less
obvious ones won't show up here - you have to THINK in order to locate those.

Example:
North - Main Road.

If you are a sun-hating Uruk, you will see # characters around sunlit exits.

For example: #West#  - Before the Guard Post
#
LEAVE
If you feel claustrophobic, typing 'leave' will make you use the nearest
obvious exit to the outside.
#
ENTER
If you type 'enter' while you are outdoors, you'll enter any nearby shelter.
You can also follow 'enter' with an argument; for example, 'enter window'.
#
TIME MONTH
  Gives you the current game time.  Your initial reaction to the output 
of this command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it.  You'll
have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this
particular notion of time; the opening hours of the shops, and the length
of days and nights, for example.
  The time is counted in Tolkien system.  The months and days you see
are used by humans on the Middle Earth.
  Westron months:        English translation:
   Narvinye                January
   Nenime                  February
   Sulime                  March
   Viresse                 April
   Lotesse                 May
   Narie                   June
   Cermie                  July
   Urime                   August
   Yavannie                September
   Narquelie               October

BUG TYPO IDEA

These standard circle muds are disabled on the Return of the Shadow.
The most common way to report bugs, typos and ideas is to post them on boards
or MAIL them to the corresponding gods.

Ideas:
-- Long Drawn out ideas need to be posted on the mortal boards, but
   minor ones dealing with the world, like add an object here, or a
   mob here, or a room here, should go to Death & Loman if on the west
   side of the Anduin, and to Fingolfin if on the East side. Minor coding
   ideas should be posted or sent to Seether or Dim, but I'm warning you,
   the "To Be Coded" list is very long, so you may not receive your
   wish nor a response for quite a while if you mail, if you post
   one of our many high gods is bound to make some remarks about it.
 
Typos:
-- All typos in room names, and room/mob/object descriptions should go to
   Fingolfin, Loman or Death. All typos in a social should go to Erika, and
   all other typos dealing with messages that you are sent should be sent to
   Dim or Prami, as they are more than likely located in the code... However 
   remember that Dim and other Imms are very busy people, so don't expect 
   typos in unimportant messages in the code to be changed very quickly.
 
Bugs:
-- Bugs dealing with mobs loading in bad places, and objects loading in the
   wrong places, and other such world problems should be sent to Fingolfin, 
   Loman or Death, all other bugs are in the code, and should be mailed more 
   than likely to Seether, our bug expert.  If the bug is severe (like 50 
   Innkeepers loading in the Inn), be sure you narrate this bug.

See: BOARD
#
BOARD NEXT

Boards are ways of communications between mortals and immortals.
The main boards are located at the innkeeper (2 boards for good/evil
races at the corresponding rooms).
To write a message on board:

write <title of the message>
> write Idea for the new spell

When you start a message, you are put into EDITOR (See help EDITOR).

To see contents of the board, do
> look board
It will show only unread messages on that board. To see all messages, do
> look board all

To read messages, use commands:
> read <number of the message>
or 
> next
to read the next unread message.

If you have a number of unread message, and you wish to catch up,
> next <number of the message>
will show you the corresponding message, and mark this message as
last read.

Note that command bug/idea/typo are currently NOT working.
Please use boards or mail to write bugs/ideas/typos. (help idea)
#
QUIT
When you get tired of playing, you can leave the game by typing 'quit'.
Note that quitting this way causes any items you might be carrying to
simply be left on the ground.  If you wish to have your equipment stored (and
you *really* do), you'll have to find an inn and pay rent.

See also: INN RENT
#
GET TAKE
If you find something interesting on the ground, you may use 'get' to pick
it up.  GET can also be used to extract items from containers.

> get sword corpse
> get all corpse
> get all all.bag
> get all.bread all.bag

See also: DROP PUT
#
PUT
For putting items into containers.

EXAMINE

'examine <item>' may give you some valuable information about an item.

'examine <n/s/w/e/u/d>' will give you detailed information about the
room over there.

'examine' will give you detailed information about the room you are in.

#
WRITE
In order to write a note, you need a piece of blank paper (or similar), and
a pen of some sort. You can then type something like "write on the paper with
the pen", whereupon you'll be asked to type in your note at the keyboard.

#
WAKE SLEEPING REST SIT STAND
For changing your position.  If you feel weary, it's probably a good idea
to sit and rest for a while, or maybe even take a nap.
#
CONCENTRATE
  Concentrate: if you type "concentrate", you will fall into trance
similar to spellcasting. In this state, you cannot do anything, and
if you are fighting, you will not hit your opponent. However, if
you are fighting mentally, you will find your mental defense improved.
Other beneficial effects will be added shortly. This trance will not
be broken by a successful hit upon you. You can break your concentration
by pressing "enter" over an empty line, similar to spellcasting.
Concentrate will also shorten the duration of confuse.

#
FLEE

   If you are in a fight and things are beginning to get a little
uncomfortable (maybe your are dying), just type 'flee', and presto!
you are out of harm's way - that is, IF there is a suitable exit
nearby, and IF that exit doesn't simply bring you from the ashes to
the fire... but then, who wants to live forever?  Fleeing requires
calm mind so make sure you are not in uncontrollable rage.

Tells the room of every player in your zone, excluding players of
the other side of the war. (Eg. if an Elf types where, he won't see
the location of an Uruk-Hai)
#
LEVELS
Lists the levels of your class. 

Note that levels are unlimited, but after level 30 you are considered a legend.

#
BRIEF SPAM
Toggle "brief mode".  When in brief mode, you don't see the descriptions of
the room you are in; only the name of the room and the people and objects
there.  Unless you're very familiar with the area in which you're traveling,
however, it is not advisable to use this command.  Frequently, you will find
small but vital hints in the descriptions of the rooms: An extra peek at your
surroundings could mean the difference between life and death!
"Spam mode", or to be more precise, "No-spam mode" is even shorter version
of brief mode. In spam mode you don't see people following you, and
you see only those messages during the fight which do damage (all parry/
dodge/miss messages are skipped).
To switch into "brief mode", do
> set brief on     (the default for brief mode is off)
To switch into "spam mode", do
> set spam off     (the default for spam mode is on)

See also: COMPACT, SET
#
! ^

Use ! to repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.

Use ^ to replace a string from the last command with a new string.  The
syntax is the same as in csh: "^old-string^replacement"  For example:

> tell rasmusse Hi there, how are you?
No-one by that name here.

> ^rasmusse^rasmussen
You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you?'

> ^you^you doing^
You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you doing?'
#
COMPARE
Using this command, you will try to compare two pieces of comparable equipment
you have in your inventory.  Note that the comparison may be very approximate.

Usage: compare <one object> <another object>

Example: compare sword 2.sword

Note: The command is not fool-proof. If you wish to compare a shield and an
axe, and you "compare shield axe", you will try to compare them... just 
expect stupid results.
#
CONSIDER
Usage : consider <monster>
This command will compare your Level with the <monsters> level. You will then
receive a rough estimate, which is by no means exact. Consider does not take
hitpoints/special attacks/damage into accout.

> consider wolf
#
EXPERIENCE XP

Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points. When
enough experience points are earned, you raise a level.
Things you should know about experience points:

  * When damaging a monster, you get experience points.

  * If you kill a monster of higher level than yourself, you get bonus
    experience points. If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points

/* WILL BE CHANGED */

Usage : GROUP [player]
	GROUP all

GROUP with no arguments shows the status of your group.  GROUP <player>
adds or removes <player> from your group.  GROUP ALL adds everyone who is
following you to your group.

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equally among the group. Experience points will only be shared among
group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow. Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
"group all" groups all people who are following you.

Example:

Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

Dragon  : "group redferne"
Dragon  : "group quifael"

Later when Dragon get upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the time)
he types : "Group Quifael" to kick Quifael out of the group.

Using staff's will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a
room, except yourself. Therefore staff's are naturally very powerful, and
yet may be very dangerous to use around other players.

Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be either a
character or an object.

Both staff's and wand's must be HELD in the hand prior to use! (Use the
grab or hold commands). You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion.

NOSUMMON
Due to problems we've had with players killing other players by summoning
them to Bad Places, all characters now have SUMMON PROTECTION turned on by
default.  This prevents people from summoning you and gives you a warning
message if someone tries.  If you want to let someone summon you (i.e. if
someone wants to summon you for a legitamate reason), turn off NOSUMMON to turn
off summon protection.  You can then turn NOSUMMON on again to turn protection
back on.
> set nosum on    -- turn nosummon on
> set nosum off   -- everyone will be able to summon you
> set nosum       -- tell you the current stats of summon protection.

LINK LINKLESS LINKRENT

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each time
    someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to survive by fleeing for
    about 20-30 minutes, then you will be saved by divine forces, and put in
    a safe place until you reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.

    If you lose a link, it's highly recommended that you login back into the
    game and RENT properly.

Note also that linkrenting will cost you astronomically more money than a
correct rental.

MAIL SEND

 Mail may be sent and received only at postmaster mobs. There is one of these
in each city or town for all races. A player must be level 10 or greater to
be able to use the mail system, and it costs 2 silver per stamp to send a
letter.

 Every time you log a character in there is a line displayed telling you if
you have new mail messages waiting.
 Example: You have new mail waiting.
                --or--
          There is no new mail for you.

 The rules for using mail are simple. Use mail to contact others for personal
reasons, do not use the message boards. Use mail to contact immortals in order
to report bugs, compliments, or complaints, though you may also use boards for
these purposes. Do not use mail for flames or other offensive remarks, doing
so will result in losing the use of the mail system.

 Commands:

mail <player> - Use this command at a postmaster mob to send another player
                 a message.
               - type write <player> to enter the mail editor. Then type the 
                 message you wish to send. Remember to hit %f to format the
                 message so that it appears intelligible to the recipient.
                 To finish and send the message type %e.
                 Example:
                   write Vaitya <enter>
                   hello. <enter>
                   %f <enter>
                   %e <enter>

Receive        - Use this command at a post master to receive all of your new
                 messages.

Look mail      - Use this to view a letter. If you have multiple letters, use
                 look letter, look 2.letter etc.

SAY TELL ASK WHISPER YELL NARRATE CHAT PETITION SING '

If you consider communicating with other beings, you might be understood
better if you start your sentences with any of these commands.

The "say" command is heard by everyone in your room.
You can use ' as a shorthand for say, as in: ' hello there.
example: say hello, my name is Bob

The "narrate","chat",and "sing" commands are heard by everyone in the world,
excluding people on the other side of the race war.
Examples: 
  narrate There is a Uruk near the ferry!
  chat Hello World
  sing There is a lady who is sure, all that glitters is gold...

The "petition" command is heard by gods only. Please do not abuse this
command.  Its content should be dedicated to problems that demand immediate 
attention of immortals. For minor bugs and problems please use boards.
Example: petition For some reason when I eat, I lose half my moves!

The "tell","whisper", and "ask" commands are heard by the given player only.
You can tell to anyone in the world, you can only whisper and ask people in
your room.
Examples:
  tell Fuor where are you?
  ask Tork could you loan me some gold?
  whisper Kiri don't let them know where we are going.
  
The "yell" command is heard by everyone in your zone, including people on
the other side of the race war. This is a good way to insult your enemies.

INN INNS CRYOGENIC CRYO RECEPTION
Inns are places where the weary traveler may rest while the innkeeper looks
after his equipment and treasure.

Specifically, the game will save your equipment while you are logged out.
There is a daily cost for renting, based on your equipment.  Each item has
a per diem charge.  The per diem charge is calculated to the nearest second,
however -- if you rent at the rate of 2400 coins per day, and you come back
39 hours later, you will be charged 3900 coins.
NOTE: RENT IS FREE NOW.

There are no CRYOGENIC CENTER in the game because they contradict Tolkien
theme.  

Rent files are deleted if you run out of money to pay the per diem charges
or after 30 days. 

See also: OFFER RENT
#
OFFER RENT
For use in the receptions of inns.

Offer makes the innkeeper tell you the cost of storing your belongings
for one day.  Rent stores your belongings and exits you from the game.
When you re-enter, you will start where you rented. Remember that the
price you are given by the innkeeper is the price for only the first
day of rent. For every day after the first, you will be charged
substantially less to remain rented.

See INNS for details on the rent policy.

> offer
> rent

RENT also recognizes two options: RETIRE and NAMECHANGE.

NEWS POLICY CREDITS VERSION RULES

These commands show you important information about Return of the Shadow.  
It is a good idea to keep yourself updated on these information often.

news     - latest changes to the code and areas - KEEP TRACK OF THIS!!
policy   - rules of the game. 
credits  - the people who made CircleMUD possible!
version  - displays the current version number of the Return of the Shadow

Syntax:
news - lists unread news messages.
news next - lets you read the next unready news.
news all - shows a list of all news messages
news <number> - allows you to read a news message by number.
news next <number> - sets message <number> as a last read message
Example: news 583

It is critical to keep track of the news messages as they contain
information that _will_ affect your game play. You will be told when
you enter the game how many unread news messages exit.

Also, note that these important commands work from anywhere in Arda,
so you do not need to find a news board, or news mob, such things do
not exist.
#
PORT 3791

The current address of this mud is "rotsmud.org 3791".
"rotsmud.org" is also known as hostname.
current ip is "50.116.33.203" (subject to change)
"3791" is also known as port.

There is a very simple reason for the choice of our port number.  Thanks to
Mickey for suggesting it.  It comes from one of the most important parts of
Lord of the Rings:

"Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
   Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
 Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
   One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
 In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
   One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
   One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
 In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie."

(3 Elven rings, 7 Dwarven rings, 9 Human Rings, and the One Ring = 3791)
#
WIZLIST IMMLIST

#

ANSI COLOR COLOUR

If you have a colour-capable terminal and wish to see useful colour-coding
of information, use the COLOUR command to select a colour scheme.  Note
that simply enabling colours is not equivalent to setting colours; choosing
a colour set is described in more detail below.

To enable ANSI colours, use:
  > colour on
To disable ANSI colours, use:
  > colour off

On RotS, we allow players to fully customize their colour scheme.  We do
this by presenting our players with a list of many different types of
actions--like giving or receiving damage--and then allowing the player
to designate a colour for that type of message.

To see the list of message types that may be coloured, or to view your
current colour settings, use:
  > colour

In order to colour a field, a player must assign one of the following
standard colours to that field:
  normal, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white.
In addition to the above colours, one may choose to enable bright or "high
colours" by prefixing "bright" to any of the colours mentioned above.  If
one does not wish to set each colour field by hand, we offer a set of
default colours.  To enable the default colour settings, use:
  > colour default

Examples of colouring a field:
  > colour hit cyan
Another example:
  > colour enemy bright white

#
PERCEPTION

   Your Perception determines how sensitive you are to the Unseen world.
This includes your ability to see and be seen by Wraiths and your reaction
to the powers of Mystics. Higher Perception makes you more resistant to
most powers, but also vulnerable to Will attacks.
   Elves have higher Perception, Dwarves - the lowest. More experienced
Mystics are also more perceptive.
   Note: your Perception does NOT define your strength in Will fighting,
only the speed of fighting. See WILL and WILLPOWER for details.

See also: MYSTIC, WILL, WILLPOWER
#
WILLPOWER
   This is the strength of your mind, your ability to strike your opponents
mentally and to resist their Will attack.
#
STRENGTH

   Strength is the raw physical power your character possess. The higher your
strength the more damage you will do in hand to hand combat. Strength also
determines how much weight your character can carry.

#
INTELLIGENCE

Intelligence affects your spellcasting. The higher your intelligence the
better your spells come out, that is the more damage some complicated spells
do, the lower the chance of spells fail.
#
DEXTERITY

can react in some situations, the higher your dexterity the better the chance 
to dodge an attack, and to flee from the fight.

#
OLOG OLOG-HAI

They were bred by Sauron in the late Third Age, possibly for the same
reason Saruman bred the Uruk-Hai, for improvement and less vulnerability
to sunlight. They lived primarily in Mordor and in southern Mirkwood.

Olog-Hais receive a bonus to bashing and have a natural health and
move regeneration. This race is intended for seasoned players because
of their complete lack of mystic and mage skills. Olog-Hais are an
extreme warrior race and can't be targeted by any healing spells due
to their natural regeneration.

#
MAGUS

These creatures are a form of orcs bred by the dreaded Magus after
the War of the Betrayal. They are weaker than normal Uruks, but more
intelligent.  They are known as Uruk-Lhuth, or spell-uruks.

Uruk-Lhuth have an insane number of penalties, and are meant to be a
challenge for the most elite of our players. First, they have
no allies in the race war. Their main enemy are the good races
of Arda, such as Elves and Hobbits, but they hate the Uruks, Common
Orc, and Harads as well.

Uruk-Lhuth may not practice any warrior skills, and have a VERY limited
select of Ranger and Mystic art. However, they have a very large
selection of magic spells to choose from, more so than any other evil
race. They also do not have any shops.
Uruk-Lhuth are resistant to poison.

in your quiver if you are wearing one, otherwise they will be placed in your
inventory.
