HELP GENERAL LEVEL
   The Valar no longer interfere with the mortal lands of Middle-Earth,
thus there are no longer any true clerics or priests.  The system of
religeon found in parts of the world still exist, but not in a pure form,
more that of a former truth held together as a lie of strength.
   But those that realized the leave of the Valar had come, and chose
to except it, still retained their habitual studies.  And so was born
the Mystic.
   Mystics are students of the "Wraith-world", specializing in the affects
of the mind and the body, using the power of their soul, their being, to
destroy their opponents.  Their tremendous will power, combined with the
ability to fight via their mind, allows them to wage battles even against
non-physical beings.
   Unlike Magic-Users, the Mystic does not need mana to use their powers,
instead drawing from Spirit, which they gain on their life path. Mystical
powers gain in strength as the Mystic gains in experience.  Note that when
using powers for other's benefit, actual benefit of the power will be an
average between the Mystic and the target's mystical ability.
