[Offensive   ] No
[Description ]
---Tracking will have you attempt to find tracks of things that have passed
through the room you are in.  The command 'track', without a target, will
attempt to show all the tracks found in the room.  Tracking a chosen <target>
will attempt to show any tracks of the target that are in the room.

Tracks do disappear over time.  Tracks can be more or less visible depending
on the weather and the terrain.

Also, one can use the command 'hunt'.  Based on one's tracking ability, they
can attempt to see the tracks in a room upon 'look'ing in and entering rooms.
The chance to successfully see tracks while hunting is less than while
tracking normally, and one will only find fresh tracks.  Also, there is a
small delay associated with hunting, which happens after looking/entering
a room.

hidden exit.  The success of a search depends primarily upon the
amount of experience the searcher has with the search skill;
however, it is also heavily based on the searcher's awareness and
intelligence.  

If you fail to uncover a hidden character in your room after
searching it, that character's hide will be less effective for
evading further detection.

Examples:

> search north

searches for a hidden exit to the north.

> search

searches for hidden characters in the room.

[Group       ] Ranger
[Level       ] 5
[Offensive   ] No
[Description ]

(not only herbs). "Gather food" lets one attempt to find some edible roots and
berries, and "gather light" finds something that burns well. "Gather energy"
and "gather healing" puts you in a mode of gathering useful herbs that help
you replentish moves or hit points. "Gather bow" will find some twigs and
branches to fashon into a crude bow. "Gather arrow" will search the room for
items that you can make into a crude arrow. Fish" command is a version of "gather
food", that allows one to fish, while holding a fishing pole and riding a
boat, if in a water room. The outcome of the gathering is strongly affected by

                         contianer.

#
SNEAK

[Syntax      ] sneak
[Group       ] Ranger
[Level       ] 5
[Offensive   ] No
[Description ]
Sneaking allows one to move between rooms without anyone taking
notice to the sneaker's entrance or exit.  When someone enters
a room without being noticed, they are effectively hidden - but
very poorly.  However, since the sneaker did not forfeit his
element of surprise by entering haphazardly, he receives quite
a formidable bonus to any stealth* related abilities that he may
perform while still unnoticed.  Since the moving character is
paying far more attention to his movements than in casual motion,
there is a small delay associated with any movement while sneak
is enabled. 

A successful discreet passage from one room to the next depends
on the sneaker's knowledge of the sneak skill and their stealth.

To toggle sneak on or off, simply type 'sneak':

> sneak

* - See SKILLS STEALTH for a description of 'stealth related
    abilities.'

#
HIDE

[Syntax      ] hide
[Group       ] Ranger
[Level       ] 2
[Offensive   ] No
[Description ]
The hide skill allows one to hide from others.  While hidden,
there is a chance people will not notice you, based on your
hide skill, ranger level, whether you entered the room with a
successful sneak, stealth, and terrain, versus the other player
or mob's awareness.  It is skill versus skill; anyone may
attempt to hide, as well as anyone can possibly see a hidden
player.  While hidden, most actions will cause you to reveal
yourself.

You may also choose to specify the WELL option when hiding.
By using HIDE WELL, you will take a substantially greater care
in choosing your hiding spot, resulting in a long wait and
enhanced concealment.

> hide well

AMBUSH TRAP

[Syntax      ] ambush <target> OR trap <target>
[Group       ] Ranger
[Level       ] 6
[Offensive   ] Yes
[Description ]
Ambush is the favored attack of rangers; and it can be used with
any weapon type.  The chance of performing a successful ambush is
determined by the attacker's ambush skill, stealth, encumbrance
and ranger level.

A successful ambush removes a percentage of target's health based
on the factors stated above for percentage chance; additionally,
the damage depends upon the damage of the weapon the ranger is
wielding and the encumbrance of the victim of the ambush.  It
should be noted that although heavy weapons increase the power of
an ambush, they increase the challenge of landing an ambush 
considerably.  In addition to damaging the victim, the surprise
and force of the ambush generally leaves the victim rather
confused, making it more difficult for him to parry.
 
> ambush wolf

The trap ability allows rangers to prepare an ambush for a target
not yet present.  When the target enters the room where a ranger
has laid a trap, the ranger will instantly spring his trap, causing
the victim a good deal of damage.  Additionally, due to the nature
of surprising a victim with such force and pain, the victim of a
successful trap will become stunned for a short period of time,
while it tries to make sense of what is happening around it.

You may choose to trap N.target; if you choose to do this, then
you will spring your trap when the Nth number of that target has
entered the trapped room.


> trap warg
> trap 2.orc
