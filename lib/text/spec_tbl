   After you become reknown and proficient in your abilities, you can
choose an area to concentrate on, in your life. The effects of your
selection vary, and can add to your abilities no matter what class you
belong to.

   Typing "specialize" without arguments will list your options. Once
you have chosen, you stay with this specialization thereon. However,
pracreset will purge your specialization, too.  (Free pracreset is a
test feature, and will be eventually disabled).

   Elemental specializations make your spells cast from the associated element
harder to save against and your spells cast from the opposing element easier to
save against.  Additionally, you are better at saving against spells from your
chosen element (and take reduced damage from such spells), but have a harder
time saving against spells from the opposing element (and take increased 
damage from such spells).  Each elemental specialization also enhances 
individual spells in unique ways, as described by the specialization.
