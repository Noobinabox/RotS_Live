#
REGISTER

Register <mob|obj|room|player|script> [number] will list the following
   
   mob      - shows the mobs in zone number [number], or current zone
              if you omit [number]
   obj      - shows the objects in zone number [number], or current zone
              if you omit [number]
   room     - shows the rooms in zone number [number], or current zone
              if you omit [number]
   player   - shows the player of level [number]
   script   - shows the scripts existing in a zone [number]
#
FINDZONE
Returns zone number(s) of zone(s) with given coordinates.

EXAMPLES:
findzone           - lists zones with their coords and titles.
findzone 17        - lists zones with their coord x == 17
findzone * 17      - lists zones with their coord y == 17
findzone 15 17     - lists zone(s) with x == 15, y == 17.
#
GOTO
goto <room number> takes you to a room with that number.
goto <alias of mobile or an object> will take you to the first
     mobile/object with this alias.
goto <player> Takes you to the specified player.
You can abbreviate goto to go.

SEE ALSO: WHERE
#
RELOAD
Usage: reload <argument>

For mysterious reasons, the only option that works is "reload xhelp".
It will correctly load help files from machine's hard drive to the memory.
#
WHERE
Usage: where <arguement>

Where for 93+ immortals doesn't work the same as for mortals. If you use
'where' without arguments, you will get listing of all players in the game,
not only in your zone.  If you put an argument, then mud will show you all
mobiles/objects/players who have your argument as alias or vnum; for example,
'where rabbit' or 'where 1513'.

#
SET
You can set many of your own flags. Type 'set' to list them.
You should probably 'SET HOLYLIGHT ON' in the begining. 
SET ROOMFLAGS will show you room number in the room you are in.
The rest of the flags should be self explanatory.
#
STAT VNUM VSTAT
STAT is used to get information about an object, a mob, or a room.
STAT <object|mob|player> Will stat that object or mob or player.
STAT ROOM will show stats of the room you're in.
VNUM <keyword> lists all existing objects and mobs with a given keyword.
  Usage: vnum obj <keyword> --or-- vnum mob <keyword>
VSTAT stats object or mob by it's virtual number.
#
LOAD
Usage: load { obj | mob } <number>
Loads a given mob or object with given virtual number.

All objects loaded by immortals now show which imm loaded if you STAT them.
#
SLAY PURGE
Slay will instantly kill the target.
Purge disintegrates a given object or mob. Purge without argument will purge
all non-PC mobs, and all objects from the room.
Note: Command kill will engage immortal in a regular combat.
#
ZRESET
Usage: zreset <zone number>
Resets a given zone.
Note that you should always purge a zone before resetting it.

This only works properly if done in the zone to be reset.
#
WIZSET
Usage: Wizset <Your name> <parameters>
Use this command to set your stats (hit points/stats/etc.).
You can abbreviate wizset to wiz.
See also: STAT
#
SAY TELL REPLY ASK WHISPER YELL NARRATE CHAT PETITION SING WIZNET ; '

For general channels immortals can control to whom their messages are
sent - that is to whities or to darkies.

<narrate | sing | chat> < -a | -w | -d | -m> <string>

The string is sent do all/whities only/darkies only /lhuth only
correspondingly. The default is -w

Another immortal only channel is wiznet (short version is semicolon)
<wiznet | ; > <string>

> chat -w Hi everyone          
> nar -d Who just killed a ferry captain?      
> sing -a Jingle bell jingle bell
> nar -l There's actually someone on here? :)
> wiznet Hey everyone.

You can use ' as a shorthand for say, as in: ' hello there.
You can use ; as a shorthand for wiznet, as in: ; hello there.

Note for immortals: See HELP <CHANNEL> for more information.

#
ZONE
Usage: zone <number>
It will show you description and map (if made) of a zone.

   All Numbering goes according to zones. Thus, say, in zone 25, all objects,
rooms, and monsters should be numbered from 2500 to 2599. Of course you can
load objects/mobs from other zones, and if you need more rooms, another zone
can always be given to you.
#
SYSLOG

Gives you on-screen system log.  Choose your option depending on how
much spam you can tolerate. Most of this information can be
semi-useful for most gods.

Usage:
> syslog [none/brief/normal/full]

#
INVIS
Usage: invis <number>


Makes you invisible to player and mobs below that level. Useful so that agg
mobs don't attack you (because they don't see you). You can type 'invis 30'
for that.

Note that talking to mortals and imms below your invis status is considered
quite rude and should not be done.
#
NOHASSLE
Usage: set nohas on

Makes agg mobs ignore you.  Very helpful when making a zone and loading
agg mobs.
#
BAN UNBAN

Ultra high god command. Consult Dim before using it!!!

These commands prevent anyone from a site with a hostname containing the
site substring from logging in to the game. You may ban a site to ALL, NEW
or SELECT players.  Banning a site to NEW players prevents any new players
from registering.  Banning a site to ALL players disallows ANY connections
from that site.  Banning a site SELECTively allows only players with site-ok
flags to log in from that site. Ban with no argument returns a list of
currently banned sites.
Unban removes the ban.
ban [<'ALL' | 'NEW' | 'SELECT'> <site>]
unban <site>
> ban new ai.mit.edu
> unban ai.mit.edu

If you ban select, you have to turn select on (that is, ban selected players).
Don't know how to do that... just don't use it.
