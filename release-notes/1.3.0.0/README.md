# RotS Code 1.3.0.0 Release Notes
This is a bugfix and first-pass specialization patch. The specializations that have been added/adjusted have not had their power budgets adjusted too much, so everything should remain more-or-less where it is power wise. This means that most of the warrior specs are a bit light in what they do (since most warrior power is passive), and the mage and mystic specs are a little bit homogenous.

## Bug Fixes/Balance Tweeks

* Fixed an issue with Big Brother protection and * mentaling.
* Fixed curse-flee-die bug, so killer will now get credit.
* Orcs get a notification when followers can't wield * something.
* Lowbie bonus health and mana regen has been reduced.
* Health is now set to 1/4 HP from 1 HP on player death.
* Some orc follower/following fixes.
* Orc recruits no longer lose moves when they are lost.
* Big Brother's lowbie protection has been reduced
* Level 10 is the maximum safe level now.

## Mages


* Reworked how the spell save system works. This should lead to smobs saving less * frequently against spells, and players saving slightly more frequently.
* Specializations now add an effective 6 flat mage levels instead of offering less power * the higher level mage the character was.
* Nerfed chill ray/shout of pain's lock-out. (Can no longer reduce the victim's energy below 0.)
* Elemental specializations now enhance different spells in different ways. They no * longer grant resistance or vulnerability, but instead make it easier/harder to save * against spells of the same/opposing element.
* Added lightning and darkness specializations.
* Protection spec applies to "shield" spell, and regen spec applies to "cure self" and "vitalize self".

## Mystics


* Specializations now add an effective 6 flat mystic levels instead of offering less * power the higher level mystic the character was.
* Changed how "Resist Magic" works to fit into the new spell save system.
* Protection spec now enhances "Resist Magic" and "Evasion".
* Spirits now grant 3x the spirit.

## Warriors

* Added "Heavy Fighting", "Light Fighting", and "Defender" specializations.
* Heavy Fighting warriors excel at fighting in heavy armor and using big, bulky weapons. * When wearing heavy armor, they suffer less encumbrance than other characters. When * using heavy weapons, they swing faster or harder.
* Light Fighting warriors excel at quick strikes. They can occasionally double-strike.
* Defender warriors excel at protecting themselves. They are more durable, and can block attacks.

## Orcs
* Orc mage followers now know all spells that they can cast to 100% knowledge (this should reduce cast failures).

## Things to Watch for / Impressions

* I am unsure if the chill ray nerf will end up being too steep. If it looks that way, * we can tone it down a bit. I expect that with smobs having a harder time saving * against spells, it should be in an alright spot.
* Archery and stealth specs may be a little bit undertuned.
* Mystic specs that aren't illusion or guardian are still probably a bit undertuned.
* All warrior specs need work in order to better emphasize the strength of the spec. * This is going to require some balance work elsewhere though.
