### Tick Display

### Gather
There has been two new features added to the gather skill, poison and antidote. It is now possible to gather a vial of poison or antidote using the gather command.

### Apply
This is a new command added to the game. Apply can be used to either add poison to a weapon or apply an antidote to yourself or a target. Applying poison to a weapon comes with a risk of accidentally poisoned yourself, this is determined based off your ranger level and gather skill. Once a weapon and/or arrow has been poisoned it will retain the poison status until a successful hit has used all the poison. The item will retain it's poisoned status over rent as well.

Applying an antidote will only be able to remove a weak poison and/or a poison almost at the end of it's duration. This means a mystic's poison power will can not be removed from the antidote.

It will also show a (marked) next to the targets name.
