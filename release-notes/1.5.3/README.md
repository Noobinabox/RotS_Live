# RotS Release Notes 1.5.3
This is a feature, new race, and bugfix patch. The new race Olog-Hais have been added to the game, along with all their new abilities.

## Bug Fixes / Balance Tweeks

* Maul has been changed to naturally decay over time. In addition the
  time and counters are now tied together so you don't have to manage
  both when buffing.
* The chance for swipe has been reduced to balance Beorning damage.
* Archery will now be affected by the hallucinate power
