Drelidan:
* Orc followers can no longer cast Whitie or Lhuth spells.
* Fixed groll command for v1.0.2
* Continued implementing the WaitList and CombatManagement replacements (there's a long way to go).
* The 'shoot' command now ignores leather armor, and reduces chains effectiveness by 50%.
* Evasion buffed against non-mystics.
