/* Some nameservers (such as the one here at JHU) are slow and cause the
   game to lag terribly every time someone logs in.  The lag is caused by
   the gethostbyaddr() function -- the function which resolves a numeric
   IP address (such as 128.220.13.30) into an alphabetic name (such as
   circle.cs.jhu.edu).

   The nameserver at JHU can get so bad at times that the incredible lag
   caused by gethostbyaddr() isn't worth the luxury of having names
   instead of numbers for players' sitenames.

   If your nameserver is fast, set the variable below to NO.  If your
   nameserver is slow, of it you would simply prefer to have numbers
   instead of names for some other reason, set the variable to YES.

   You can experiment with the setting of nameserver_is_slow on-line using
   the SLOWNS command from within the MUD.
